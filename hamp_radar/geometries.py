    section 2.3.3 'Main chunk structure'.

    The sub-blocks of a SingleMainBlockGeometry correspond to each of the blocks
    in the embedded chunk chain which composes the main chunk.

    Attributes:
        tag (str): The tag / frame header describing the data in the sub-blocks.
        offset (int): Pointer to start of the main block's sub-blocks, relative to the file.
        size (int): The size of the main block's sub-blocks (bytes).

    Allows for 'count' number of SingleMainBlockGeometry instances to be
    combined, assuming they are similar enough (e.g. same subblocks, same offset,
    same tag etc.). (See compact_geometry function.)

    Attributes:
        tag (str): The tag/signature describing the main blocks.
        offset (int): Pointer to the start of the first main block.
        count (int): The number of SingleMainBlockGeometry instances
                     combined to make the MultiMainBlockGeometry instance.
        step (Optional[int]): The distance between each SingleMainBlockGeometry
